Documentation: Add comprehensive examples for classes and update all examples
for the new architecture.

New ``classes.rst`` documentation provides detailed examples of using immutable
classes, dataclasses, and protocols. All existing examples have been updated to
work with the ``classcore``-based implementation while maintaining the same
user-facing API.
